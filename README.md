# Capstone

## Project Description
My capstone is a web app that helps users figure out what to eat when they can't figure out what. They can either choose between eating out or making something at home with a list of recipes they can add, delete or edit. This web application uses a frontend and a backend, which I will go into how they were created in the next section below.

## Technologies Used
The frontend was created with React, JavaScript and some CSS for the styling where the navigation from page to page was done with Link from react-router-dom. The backend was created with JavaScript and uses Moongoose to get, send and delete data from MongoDB which stores all the data. The frontend and backend was connected with axios and all of the code was done in Microsoft Visual Studio Code and committed to a GitHub Repository. I also used a blank API to retrieve the data for the "eat out" option, which is linked below in acknowledgments.

## Approach Taken
I started with figuring out what I was going to do for this capstone then started with the recipes section as that was going to be the hardest since that utilized CRUD. After taking five days to get all the functionality done, from setting up the database, connecting the backend to the frontend, and making sure all the CRUD capabilites works, I then went to work on styling, which was alot complicated than I thought. With the recipe section done and the styling done, I then went onto finding a good fast food/restarant API for the eat out section, which also took longer than expected.

## How To Use 
On the homepage, users have two options: "Make Something At Home" and "Go Out To Eat". 

If users pick "Make Something At Home", users can either search for a recipe, show all recipes on the list, or add one. If they choose to add a recipe, users will have to fill out a form of the meal type, the name of the dish, how difficult it is to make it, how long it will take in minutes and the ingredients. Users can also edit or delete the recipes on their list.

If users pick "Go Out To Eat"...
